What is this project?:
it is a webapp that you can use on your phone or tablet to remotely control your desktop cursor,
it also allows you to type from your phone to your desktop as well so pretty much this is just a remote mouse and keyboard.
What else can i say? Have fun! :)

~~Oh also you only need the exe to run this program but you have to put that exe inside a folder so when it generates the qr code it doesn't end up on a random place on your desktop.~~ Yeah i fixed that you can just put the exe to your desktop and allow for public networks on windows(it wont work otherwise). Be careful of using this program outside. i did add some precautions like using a pincode to get approved but i recommend you to stick to using this program in your home.
